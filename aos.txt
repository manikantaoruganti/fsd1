Track 1 – Real World Assets on Andromeda: Bridging the Physical and Digital

Objective
OptiVaultAI aims to bridge the gap between tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and high-yield decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies.
By combining Andromeda’s ADO-based composability with AI-driven decision-making, OptiVaultAI enables enterprises and individuals to tokenize physical assets (real estate, gold, IP rights), fractionalize them, and automatically deploy them into optimal earning protocols across the Cosmos ecosystem.

Implementation
1. RWA Tokenization Engine

Uses Andromeda’s CW721, CW20, and Splitter ADOs to mint and fractionalize digital representations of RWAs.

Metadata is stored securely on IPFS.

2. Smart Distribution Layer

Uses ADOs like Weighted Distribution Splitter, Auction, and Conditional Splitter to enable revenue sharing, ownership transfers, and vesting.

3. AI Strategy Router

An AI module that analyzes market conditions, risks, and yields to dynamically allocate tokenized assets into DeFi strategies.

4. Cross-chain Interoperability & UI

React + Tailwind frontend

FastAPI backend linked to aOS, with Pulsar onboarding flows

Cross-chain asset handling using Cosmos-native bridges

Applications
Tokenized Real Estate Portfolios

Collectibles and Vintage Goods Fractional Vaults

IP Rights Revenue Streaming

Gold and Commodities Staking Pools

AI-Powered DeFi Yield Allocation for Asset Owners

Final Result
A fully functional dApp where users can onboard, tokenize, and yield-optimize real-world assets in just a few clicks.
AI handles routing, while all logic and automations are managed by ADOs.
Users have full transparency through real-time dashboards showing ownership breakdowns, earnings, and strategy performance.
